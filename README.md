# PISA-Evaluation
 This is  a proposal PISA type evaluation co-authorized with developer Fernando Silveira.

 Its main purpouse is to show a brand new way of positive learning to help pre-teens out to improve their knowledge before they get applied with PISA test.

 On the other hand, is pretty important to know that this code is NOT the ultimate model to practice for PISA test, this just a pilot or either a blueprint that may be modified for whether improvement or accuracy in order to shape-fit it with each middle school necessities.

Hope you like it and help you out as well.
